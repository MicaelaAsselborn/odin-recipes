# odin-recipes
This is my first "The Odin Project" project. 

I have to build a really simple recipes page using only HTML, which at this point is no challenge for me as I already completed the Responsive Web Developer course from freeCodeCamp, but I entered into the TOP with full intention of following all the steps, so here I am, following the steps to the line, although I might add some of my "flavor" to it (pun intended).

I have to clarify that even thought I say this specific task is no challenge for me, I am in under no light a developer yet, and I love every feedback I receive, as it will help me to keep growing.

I have to say, I did not had any experience with Git Bash, as until now, I was relying on the VS Code terminal, so it felt really rewarding getting up to this point, after fighting my way trough all those code lines in Git Bash. 

It was interesting see how to link a local file that is on a parent folder.

Also learned how to properly link img situated on siblings folders. I had to go back with ../ and just then select the img folder.

By the way this is the first time I bother to fill a README file, most of the time I donÂ´t even include them, am I using it right?
